Objective:

The objective of the Environmental Guardian: Pollution Level Detector experiment utilizing ESP32 microcontroller is to design, develop and test a reliable and efficient pollution level detector to monitor and measure various environmental parameters such as carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), and other harmful gases. It provides real-time data to users for proactive measures to reduce pollution and protect the environment. Through this experiment, we seek to enhance awareness and understanding of environmental pollution, facilitate real-time monitoring, and contribute to the promotion of sustainable practices for a healthier planet.

Motivation:

Rising concerns over environmental pollution's adverse effects on human health and ecosystems served as the primary motivation. Recognizing the urgency to bridge the gap between traditional pollution monitoring methods and modern technological advancements to achieve more accurate, timely, and accessible data for informed decision-making. Leveraging the potential of emerging technologies, such as IoT and embedded systems, to democratize access to pollution data, foster environmental awareness, and catalyze collective action towards achieving cleaner and healthier environments. With urbanization and industrialization on the rise, monitoring pollution levels has become essential for sustainable development and public health. Ultimately, the motivation behind this experiment lies in our collective commitment to fostering a sustainable and resilient planet, where every individual has the opportunity to thrive in harmony with nature, free from the burdens of pollution and environmental degradation.

Methodology:

⮚Circuit Design:
The pollution level detector utilizes MQ7, MQ135, and MQ2 gas sensors connected to the ESP32 microcontroller. These sensors detect CO2, NH3, CO, and other gases in the environment. The circuit collects data from these sensors, processes it, and calculates pollution levels.

⮚Pollution level detectors can be installed at transportation hubs such as airports, train stations, and bus terminals to monitor emissions from vehicles and aircraft. 
⮚Construction activities often generate dust, particulate matter, and other pollutants that can impact air quality in nearby neighborhoods. Pollution level detectors deployed at construction sites enable project managers to monitor emissions and implement dust control measures.
⮚Agricultural activities, can contribute to air and water pollution through the release of agricultural chemicals, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases. Pollution level detectors that are installed can help farmers monitor pollution levels and implement sustainable farming practices to minimize environmental impact while maximizing productivity.
⮚Pollution level detectors are valuable tools for scientific research and environmental monitoring initiatives aimed at understanding pollution trends, assessing the effectiveness of pollution control measures, and identifying emerging environmental threats.

Future Scope:

Future enhancements may include improving measurement accuracy through advanced sensor technologies and calibration techniques. Integration with cloud-based platforms can facilitate data aggregation and analysis on a larger scale. Integrating multiple sensors with complementary capabilities, such as optical sensors for particulate matter and electrochemical sensors for gases, can improve measurement accuracy and provide a more comprehensive understanding of pollution dynamics. Developing mobile applications that interface with the pollution level detector allows users to access real-time pollution data, receive alerts, and contribute to crowdsourced pollution mapping efforts. Additionally, incorporating machine learning algorithms can enable pollution trend prediction and provide actionable insights for pollution control measures.
